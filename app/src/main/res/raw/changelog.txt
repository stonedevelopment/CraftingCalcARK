    $ 0.2.6a
      % Version 0.2.6a
      _ 10/05/2016
      * Redesigned layouts to fit most screens, including Tablets! (Still not sure about TVs or Chromebooks)
      * Fixed a few bugs you guys came across, should be pretty stable again.
      ! If your display is funky, please tweet or email a screenshot and include the type of device you're using, thanks!!

    $ 0.2.5a
      % Version 0.2.5a
      _ 10/01/2016
      * Removed the Toast message when you click on crafting queue item, remnants of earlier bugfix.
      * Last update for the weekend, promises!

    $ 0.2.4a
      % Version 0.2.4a
      _ 10/01/2016
      * Hopefully fixed images not showing up on app release config. Weird bug.

    $ 0.2.3a
      % Version 0.2.3a
      _ 09/30/2016
      * Added a sort method for Resources in ListViews.

    $ 0.2.2a
      % Version 0.2.2a
      _ 09/30/2016
      * Includes all engrams up to Non-DLC PC version 247.0!
      * Added loading screen for database initialization, finally.
      * Migrated all data from initializer classes to JSON file.
      ! I will be adding DLC engrams in the near future!

    $ 0.2.1a
      % Version 0.2.1a
      _ 08/19/2016
      * Reworked how Engrams are shown, now full screen if crafting queue is empty.
      * Fixed tiny bug where the 'All [Filtered]' toggle was backwards.

    $ 0.2.0a
      % Version 0.2.0a
      _ 08/18/2016
      * Added 'Raw/Refined' setting, toggling this will breakdown the Resources that are also Engrams.
      * Android Wear app might have to be a separate deal, compiler won't allow a minimum SDK of KitKat to compile and since I have users with that OS, I'll have to figure something else out later.
      ! I hope you've enjoyed this app so far, adding a few more features then will be pushing this to production! Anything you think is missing or any bugs you're finding, please let me know! You can find contact info in the About dialog.

    $ 0.1.9a
      % Version 0.1.9a
      _ 08/15/2016
      * Fixed an annoyance where changes in orientation reverted the current category level back to its root level.
      * Coming soon: Android Wear compatibilities! Imagine your resource list attached to your wrist!

    $ 0.1.8a
      % Version 0.1.8a
      _ 08/06/2016
      * Fixed a bug found by Google's Pre-Launch Report where HelpDialog needed to pull the compatible context for older versions.

      % Version 0.1.7a
      _ 08/06/2016
      * Added support for Android OS versions down to KitKat.

   $ 0.1.6a
      % Version 0.1.6a
      _ 08/05/2016
      * Added landscape mode support. Detail activity is still a little... *eh*, but it'll do for now.

    $ 0.1.5a
      % Version 0.1.5a
      _ 08/04/2016
      * Fixed what I broke in last release, which helped me optimize the Crafting Queue and its objects. *WIN*

    $ 0.1.4a
      % Version 0.1.4a
      _ 08/04/2016
      * Reworked increasing quantities to help make the display respond quicker. It's still not as fast as I'd like, but it's tolerable.

    $ 0.1.3a
      % Version 0.1.3a
      _ 08/03/2016
      * Fixed smaller/larger screen size issue, programmatically. Will introduce specific layouts in a future release.

      % Version 0.1.2a
      _ 08/02/2016
      * Third times a charm! Hopefully first official release of this app! (Impersonation Infringement, again. ARK:Resource Calculator was too much like ARK:Survival Evolved.)

      % Version 0.1.1a
      _ 07/31/2016
      * Second alpha release of this app! (Impersonation Infringement. Logo was too similar.)
      * Includes all engrams up to PC version 245.0!

      % Version 0.1.0a
      _ 07/29/2016
      * First alpha release of this app!
      * Includes all engrams up to PC version 244.72!
