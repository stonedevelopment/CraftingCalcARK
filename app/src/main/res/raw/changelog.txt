    $ 0.1.9a
      % Version 0.1.9a
      _ 08/15/2016
      * Fixed an annoyance where changes in orientation reverted the current category level back to its root level.
      * Coming soon: Android Wear compatibilities! Imagine your resource list attached to your wrist!

    $ 0.1.8a
      % Version 0.1.8a
      _ 08/06/2016
      * Fixed a bug found by Google's Pre-Launch Report where HelpDialog needed to pull the compatible context for older versions.

    $ 0.1.7a
      % Version 0.1.7a
      _ 08/06/2016
      * Added support for Android OS versions down to KitKat.

   $ 0.1.6a
      % Version 0.1.6a
      _ 08/05/2016
      * Added landscape mode support. Detail activity is still a little... *eh*, but it'll do for now.

    $ 0.1.5a
      % Version 0.1.5a
      _ 08/04/2016
      * Fixed what I broke in last release, which helped me optimize the Crafting Queue and its objects. *WIN*

    $ 0.1.4a
      % Version 0.1.4a
      _ 08/04/2016
      * Reworked increasing quantities to help make the display respond quicker. It's still not as fast as I'd like, but it's tolerable.

    $ 0.1.3a
      % Version 0.1.3a
      _ 08/03/2016
      * Fixed smaller/larger screen size issue, programmatically. Will introduce specific layouts in a future release.

    $ 0.1.2a
      % Version 0.1.2a
      _ 08/02/2016
      * Third times a charm! Hopefully first official release of this app! (Impersonation Infringement, again. ARK:Resource Calculator was too much like ARK:Survival Evolved.)

    $ 0.1.1a
      % Version 0.1.1a
      _ 07/31/2016
      * Second alpha release of this app! (Impersonation Infringement. Logo was too similar.)
      * Includes all engrams up to PC version 245.0!

    $ 0.1.0a
      % Version 0.1.0a
      _ 07/29/2016

      * Includes all engrams up to PC version 244.72!

      ! Known issues
      * Stuttering image list when "Show All" is chosen. It still works, but is an annoyance.
